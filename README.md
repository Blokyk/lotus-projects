    lotus-console-games

A bunch of console projects written in lotus, stolen from [dotnet-console-games](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/dotnet-console-games).

This is mostly for exploring language & stdlib design, so expect inconsistencies, long comments and general weirdness. In particular, it will most likely include lang features not currently supported by the lotus compiler.
